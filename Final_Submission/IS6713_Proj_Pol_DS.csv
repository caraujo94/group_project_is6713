"Even the 911 center for the city is hiring now. Starts at $19.27 for call takers. All you need is ged or diploma, one year of experience with the public in person or over the phone, can type at least 35 words a minute and pass background check. Even get paid during classroom and on the job training. But honestly everyone getting hired now will probably get placed in afternoon or night shift with no weekends or holidays off due to seniority.",0
"The Uranusians who, with all their technology and advanced societal structure, didn’t think it was cool as they were unable to deter the path of the planet sized object that impacted their home world causing the tilt. 

They had detected the object 200 years before impact. Calculated its trajectory. They knew impact was likely. 

They dedicated 2 generations (Uranusian life span is some 150 years) of their top scientific and engineering minds to prevent the problem. 

Futile effort after futile effort, the object arrived. 

As a last ditch attempt to preserve something of their people, they loaded a small spacecraft with a few people, supplies, and information regarding their society. 

They shot the spacecraft toward Sol, hoping one of the inner planets would prove hospitable enough. 

The craft reached Earth, but only after being hyper accelerated by the gravity of Jupiter. Like a rock in a sling, Jupiter whirled the craft around and shot it out directly at earth with amazing velocity. 

This craft came crashing down to Earth in the area that is now known as the Yucatán peninsula. 

And that’s why we don’t have dinosaurs. 

So I’d say it’s pretty un-cool.",0

"I’ve only been working from home for a week, but I do have one small tip for folks who work with or supervise a team.

If your typically work with a team/group, stay engaged with them as much as possible. Via phone, email, chat, or whatever other mechanism. If you lead a team, it’s good to check in with them a few times daily. Just to see how their day is going.

For those that are new to working from home, not being around people all day may be an enormous change.",0

"I know you're looking for Lesbian bars but unfortunately, they don't exist anymore in SA. There is always the strip as people have already mentioned along with the new ""lesbian night"" starting this month at Phantom Room.

Throughout my years here, I've kinda moved away from LGBT only places, though i do visit the strip every once in a while. My tastes are just different these days and I go to see old friends here and there. 

Not sure what your music tastes are but my friend Dj Eri and I, Dj every last Saturday of the month at Southtown 101. No, it's not a LGBT bar, but it's a little dive place that is open to all especially when I'm djing because well, I'm lesbian. (well that's the closest I can describe my preference) 

Anyway, if you're ever interested in music that is different from what the strip offers, feel free to check out our night.

That being said, my Model 3 (and all Teslas) has what is called ""Valet Mode"" which can only be enabled/disabled via a PIN the owner sets or via the app on the owner's phone. It limits the speed to 20mph or so and prevents anyone from changing settings (e.g. enabling cheetah mode). Not sure when this was taken, and not sure if it wasn't an available feature on this person's Tesla for whatever reason.

Either way, hope that valet driver gets canned and I hope the company he works for pays for a new car. If the car had cheetah mode, it means the vehicle is one of the higher end models that STARTS at 60k+.",0

"I agree that they prevented something worse, but they did it the wrong way. Shutting down neighborhoods, and advising people to use as little energy as possible was not enough when I know there were car dealerships, phone stores, skyscrapers, and empty businesses that were nice and toasty with no one inside. Get the owners to flip a breaker off, turn off a light, or turn down the heat. 

They were willing to ask the people freezing to death to do it, but not ask or force businesses with full power that weren't open.

They could have had more targeted shut downs, and if not they could have had more targeted energy conservation. They also could have been prepared in the first place. Regardless, charge it to the people in control at the top, not the people were not warned, suffered, and still were expecting to 'conserve'.",0

Honestly, tax season turns me into a less than pleasant person to be around because it’s stressful. The money is set aside in our case as we pay estimated taxes, but wrangling in all of our paperwork and deductions is never fun. QuickBooks has helped a lot, but it can be expensive.

It’s too bad tax prep services maybe aren’t as transparent with pricing? Not sure since ai don’t use them, but it’s like when you go to the doctor and trying to sort through their fees and you just don’t know because there is no pricing transparency.

Are you immaculately cleaning the restaurant (including restrooms) every day, between meals and as required?

Put together a solid CV.  And by that I mean research and learn how to sale yourself.  You are the product.  Send it to family and friends and former co-workers/bosses to get feedback.  It is very easy to short sell yourself.  

I saw on reddit that someone got a media job by doxing themselves as a karma whore and knowing how and when to use social media.  A few weeks ago I saw a post on linkedin that they were interviewing someone that listed google as a skill.

Think of everything, and give yourself credit.  Do you just want a better paying job or do you want to work on building a career?  How can you leverage your education and experience.  Reach out on linked in to people in positions that you wish you had.  ATS sucks so networking is everything.  If you had interviews and were denied, try and figure out why.  Ask the recruiter what were your weaknesses.  Maybe there is something in your background check that you need to cleanup.

Finding a better job is now your second job.  Feel free to PM if you want.  I ended up hiring a career coach after my last layoff because people thought I was too old to do what I do.

Info from a quick google
  
&gt;   Many cars, motorcycles, boats, aircraft and tools have engines that run worse, or have parts that deteriorate, when run on gasoline that contains ethanol. In addition, ethanol leaves residue on valves and other parts that can hinder performance.  
  
---

&gt; Pure gas gives better mileage than E10, and much better than E85, simply because gasoline has higher free energy than ethanol. The free energy of gasoline is 34.2 MJ per liter. The free energy of ethanol is 24.0 MJ per liter. That means E10 (10% ethanol) has a free energy of 33.2 MJ per liter, and E85 (85% ethanol) has a free energy of 25.6 MJ per liter.

"the thing is, there will always still be someone who will resort to the clothes hanger. A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

More than likely now, women will just google which OTC pills can cause abortions/miscarriages and go for that. A more modern clothes hanger.",1

"$18.00 to $20.00 an hour, 40 hours a week, average taxes, no health insurance deduction. The way I figure expenses is $1200.00 per month rent for a 1 bedroom in a nicer area in a nicer apartment (not top of the line but comfortable).  $100 a month utilities, who knows what it will really cost but for an apartment that is not running the a/c at 70 degrees all day, maybe that's a reasonable number. $100 a month cell phone and internet, again, I don't know how much your plan will cost this is just an estimate. $400.00 a month for food from a grocery store (not including restaurants or delivery) for one person buying most of the things they want not on sale, there is no way for me to know how much you really eat. $400.00 car payment, $100 a month car insurance, again, no way for me to know how much your car payment or insurance is. $50.00 a month for incidentals (new clothes for work, a higher than normal utility bill, etc) $50.00 a month for gas, no way for me to know how much you drive.  That is $2400.00 expenses every month. $18.00 an hour is $2460 average monthly take home pay. $20.00 an hour is $2717 monthly take home. There is no way to calculate this 100% correctly since there are too many variables (deductions, health insurance, etc).   You would need to make much more than $20.00 an hour if you have to pay, for example, $500.00 a month for health insurance or if your car payment is $1000.00 a month, or whatever.

"So. I’ve done this. Worked in NW Austin for about 18 months, lived in SA. Or better to say I slept in SA, worked in Austin, lived in my car. 

It’s not ideal, but doable if you have to. My logic at the time was that I would have a long commute if I moved to any other tech town like, NY, SF, Seattle, etc. I left my house at 6am, got home at 7:30pm. The biggest problem I had was the hour of slow stop-go traffic getting out of ATX, that shit made me so sleepy. Sun in my eyes. It was dangerous many times on I-35, being on it everyday upped my chances of getting in a wreck substantially. I never got into a wreck but many many times it was close. 

My guidance is don’t do it if you don’t have to. Yes, you can get used to the mind numbing car ride, but it’s very taxing on you overtime. You’ll be gassing up your car every other day.  

PROTIP: when you go back and forth from here to ATX, you really see how vastly different the two towns are. People are so different. You start to question how many total facial piercings your office has collectively, why every white dude over 30 wears a golf shirt tucked into blue jeans, and they all sound like Matthew McConaughey...oh, and you’re going to see more office supplies in the color of “burnt orange” than you ever thought possible.

"""H-E-B said it has expanded its multi-year deal with marketing technology and in-store customer experience provider Stratacache — an ongoing deal that provides the food retailer with greater digital insights into its customers.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, can be custom-tailored to the grocery vertical offers retailers the ability to deeply personalize online shopping experiences instead of compelling shoppers to wade through tens of thousands of possible choices. ThryveAI, a Mi9 Retail retail brand, launched last month and already touts supermarket clients such as Meijer, Wakefern Food Corp., ShopRite, Mariano's, Giant Eagle and more. Now, ThryveAI has partnered with taste intelligence company Halla to integrate grocery-specific AI into the ThryveAI digital commerce platform""

You could talk to TWC and see if they will take over the line.  They can cut it, strip for a new end, and it back to a splicer on their box.

If you're worried about aesthetics/cable management and want to stick to the original setup (running three lines to the second room instead), you might want to go to through the professional route.

If you don't mind driving out to Boerne you can get trained out there and save tons of cash. The airspace is not controlled so you don't have to waste so much time and money waiting around on the taxiway and getting routed out of the SAT Class C airspace. Google 5C1 (the airport code). 

If that is not an option then check out a school at Stinson municipal. That is a towered airport but it's own Class D which is at the south edge of the busy airspace so you can get out quickly. 

This all matters because you pay for the plane and the instructor by the hour and you can spend 30+ minutes just taxiing and flying far enough away from KSAT to do your lessons. If money was no object, it does at least have the advantage of honing your radio skills very well.

"Sorry to hear that you're going through this.  I know from personal experience that it's hard.  

First, in my experience when it comes to falls, the first question that EMT's and doctors usually ask is if the person hit their head.  So take note that those type of falls are particularly serious. 

Second, I would start documenting the date of each fall in a note on your phone.  The reason for this is that when your relative eventually has an incident and you have to talk to an EMT or a doctor in the ER, you will be able to hand them your phone and show them the relative's history at a glance.  Doctors and EMT's like this type of objective data that they can review quickly.  You can also include a list of the relative's medications.  

A lot of other people have given good advice about agencies to call, so I won't add to that.  But start building your relative's case history in your phone so you have it.",0

"The Tech community in San Antonio has gotten much better in just a few years, mainly thanks to [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com/), but we still have a long way to go to catch up to Austin.

UT Austin has one of the top 10 CS programs in the nation, so definitely go there if you get accepted even if you don't plan on staying in Austin.  I'm not sure how UTSA CS ranks nowadays, but the UTSA Cybersecurity program was named #1 in the US a couple of years ago.

The big employers here in town are USAA and Rackspace.  There's also a lot of startups based out of Geekdom, but there's definitely a a lot more tech companies both big and small in Austin.  One area where we do beat Austin is Cybersecurity.  There's a lot more talent and opportunities here if security is your thing.

Not sure about the entry level help desk opportunities, but I would highly recommend joining a few monthly meetup groups in town to network with local professionals.  Check out the [Geekdom event calendar](http://geekdom.com/events/).  A lot of their events are open to non-members.  Also search on meetup.com for languages/technologies that you find interesting, since not all local tech meetups meet at Geekdom.",0

Glue and friction welds are horrible horrible things though.  
  
I can take my iPhone apart in 5 minutes to replace the battery, but when I tried to replace the display on my Galaxy Nexus (I think it was that phone), there was glue everywhere, I broke the display much more before actually freeing it from the rest of the device.  
  
Wanted to do a battery replacement on my Tile (Small location beacon for things like keys), but they friction-weld those things well.

"I keep seeing this sentiment come up and I don't get it. 

Obviously you guys don't compete with Austin for raw numbers of tech companies/employees, but to ignore the amount of talent and opportunity in SA is disingenuous. I don't know if people are grouping everything government into a ""government"" category rather than considering the individual areas *within* government, but you have Rackspace, USAA, an FBI field office, NSA Texas, and JBSA (DISA SATX, ARNORTH JOC, 24th USAF, 25th USAF, JIOWC, I could go on forever).

You officially rationalized intrusion. Even if it is as you say it is (it isn't), it doesn't make up for the principal of the fact. True, google's algorithms can figure out a lot. Wtf do you think the government is using?! Bringing up how bad other governments are doesn't make what the government is doing ""okay"". If anything, the government knows that keeping it's people comfortable allows them far more freedom to fuck over other countries than if they wanted to treat us like they were N.Korea.

People will fight for their fake ""freedom"" (usa) a lot harder than for an imposing government (n.korea) (staying within the confines of your examples).

This all goes much deeper, and we're hardly doing any side of the argument justice, here. If it was as you say it is, the bevy of guilty companies being mined wouldn't be as high as it is.",0

"I've had both Spectrum and upgraded now to Google Fiber since they became available a few months ago. I've had two failures with Google so far - one which was just a few minutes, one which was a few hours - both which were automatically credited for downtime. I was one of the first homes in my neighborhood to get it, so it's quite possible that they accidentally cut through something or plugged something in that they shouldn't have on another block. Since then, no outages.

Slowdowns and lagging does happen from time to time, but it's honestly hard to say if it's a Google thing or a YouTube thing. It's definitely not constant. I will also say that in my neighborhood, Spectrum had gotten a lot better. They were rock solid for the past two or three years. I currently pay for both Google and Spectrum (on their lowest tier) and use Spectrum as my failover, in case Google Fiber does have an extended outage. I had heard from my friends near the Medical Center and over in Austin that Google is great as long as they don't have a network problem - and if that happens, they can be out for days. As internet is critical to my job, I'm currently paying for a hot spare, just in case. I'll probably disconnect it later once I feel more confident in Google.",0

Racist should be a serious term, not something you throw out as a buzzword. You're devaluing this word and hurting the actual victims of racism in the world.

At least in my mind, isn’t making everyone drive a personal vehicle in order to go anywhere akin to government mandated car ownership? Can’t hold a job, go to school, shop, live unless you can travel to those places. 

Transportation is just the tip of the iceberg though. Transit fails for any number of reasons, but the top may as we’ll be that our preferred urban development patterns can’t support it.

I'm not having trouble. I'm actually doing quite well. I'm just disgusted by the handful of companies that is routinely passed off as a thriving and vibrant tech sector. The number of actual tech companies here - aside from my friends at Geekdom - is shockingly small. When the second-largest technical employer is a *bank*, you got issues.

A dozen companies that hire software people does not qualify as a major software industry.

&gt; Your amazon purchases normally shouldn't be 30-40% of your monthly paycheck.

You missed my point entirely. My point was that many goods, services, and expenses are *not* adjusted for local cost of living. This is not something to be dismissed out of hand. One of my coworkers is being hit extremely hard by that. I'm sure he'll be pleased to know that the cheap rent makes everything OK.

&gt; 50k a yr in SA is probably worth about 55-60k in Austin where you pay 3-400$ more a month for an apartment or mortgage, among other things.

And you might be able to get away without a car, rendering that $300-$400 a month a wash.

I was talking to a supervisor at Climate Pro the other day and they recently fired a crew member. I think they do on-the-job training. Give their website a google I've done some jobs with them here in San Antonio and some of the guys mentioned they lived near the HEB we were working on so I'm assuming they have a branch here. They probably do some travel I think we've worked with them as far as Arizona.,0

"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. ",0

"San Antonio Counseling Center is who I see my therapist through and I like them. I see my therapist online via portal

I’m also the type of person who has to understand the “why’s” of things so I also Google (or whatever search engine you want) and watch YouTube videos on psychology that speak to what I would like to learn about. 

I started my journey by searching “why am I so angry” and found out about anxiety (I honestly had no idea what it was prior to about ~6 years ago) and then I learned about depression and those symptoms. It has been a tough road but I’m happy with the progress I made. There’s been plenty of ups and downs, breakdowns and outbursts and some of them were cathartic and necessary. It can be scary to let emotions surface but it’s worth it. Just be kind to yourself as you go through your journey.",0

"Binding arbitration is one of those ideas that sounded kind of OK in theory, but in practice has turned out to be horrible. It's \*\*ALWAYS\*\* biased in favor of the more powerful party, often blatantly so.

Anecdote: I used to do tech support for a law firm in a different city, and that law firm was contracted by a large employer who hired many immigrant workers to do physically dangerous jobs. I'm being vague here deliberately. All on the job injuries were sent to binding arbitration done by lawyers at the firm where I worked.

Once I happened to overhear a couple of the lawyers who did binding arbitration chuckling because they were talking about this idiot employee who thought there was any chance at all that they'd rule against the company.

So.... Yeah. Fuck binding arbitration sideways. It's just a way for the powerful party to abuse the less powerful party.",0
"I'm on the far west side, guess this is a common issue.

I had an AT&amp;T land line and it would stop working every night after a hot day. A dozen calls to AT&amp;T and 9 blown off visits later and 3 where they told me everything was fine they told me ""it's a heat thing that only happens at night as it cools."" I asked them when they would fix it and they informed me they don't work at night, so never. I canceled my phone and the retention lady tried to sell me DSL. I asked how that could possibly work if they can't even get voice over my line and she says ""I'm sure we can get a tech out there to fix it.""

After that the only other major issue I had with TWC is the net would go out when it rained, but they replaced a very old cable in my yard and that fixed it.",0

"Here is the article. I don't need a subscription to read it. That's odd.

""On the heels of his retirement last week, Spurs star forward Tim Duncan was pictured on San Antonio real estate agent Robert Elder’s professional Facebook page holding a sign featuring the agent’s logo and web address.

There was a problem, though. Duncan never agreed to be photographed holding the sign or to endorse Elder, an agent at Keller Williams in San Antonio.

Duncan now is suing Elder, Keller Williams and some other parties alleging misappropriation of the retired basketball player’s name and image. The suit, filed in Bexar County District Court on Friday, seeks unspecified financial and punitive damages.

“It was just so blatant and so shameless,” said Michael D. Bernard, a lawyer for Duncan and former San Antonio city attorney. “We don’t want people to think this is OK or that it goes unnoticed, because it doesn’t. There is a consequence to it.”

Elder referred questions to Jack Hawthorne, general counsel for Keller Williams in San Antonio. Hawthorne declined to comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.""",0

"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.

"From the E-N:

By Richard Webner, Staff WriterAugust 4, 2016 Updated: August 4, 2016 11:04pm

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio’s City Council approved a request Thursday from the property’s current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

“It’s a brand with global cache, and it’s one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,” said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg’s office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla’s presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company’s electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer’s recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn’t respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

“It’s a corridor that’s accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,” Nirenberg said. It is “one of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.”

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of “Tesla in Texas,” which touts the company’s position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe’s cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

"Hate crimes rose significantly under Trump’s presidency, with Texas being one of the states with the most hate crimes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870%3famp=1 

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If there’s a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbi’s houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled “The Jews will not replace us” while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during Trump’s presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I can’t be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and that’s terrifying to me. 

Am I biased? Clearly. But that doesn’t make my lived experience any less real or the FBI’s data any less factual.",1

Either way, the assailant is fucked. The Internet never forgets. His shit-for-brains actions cost him whatever future he had. Given his prior arrest record, that means his employability now is nil.

"I currently have CPS Home Manager and have had it for about a year.  I really like it and it has saved us money because I never had a programmable thermostat before.  Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

"Hey there. I'm a current student and I run the news outlet, so I can give you pretty much everything you need to know. 

First off, the university is spread out over two campuses.  Main campus is 410 and S Zarzamora while the other campus is at Brooks City Base. The Main Campus is where you have mainly the College of Arts and Sciences classes (Biology, communication, English, etc). Over at Brooks City Base is where the College of Business is and that includes the various degres sin computers. Depending on your major/minor, that could mean you'll stay only at one campus or you may have to commute between the two, which takes about 20 minutes. 

Right now there are about 4500 students, with an average age of 30, but that changes in the fall. The university is enrolling freshmen and sophomores for the time, so it'll be an addition 600 students in the fall. 

That said, some of the courses for your major or to get a degree may require you to take classes at one of the Alamo College. Good thing is that TAMUSA will let almost any class transfer because they want more students. 

As for your other questions:

- The university is not ""well respected"" because a lot of people don't even know it exists. Prior to it having a campus, TAMUSA was actually in other buildings across the city. 

- The area of town is fairly empty right now. The nearest house is about a mile away from the actual university. In fact, the university is surrounded by a ranch where horses and cows graze and you'll see the occasional road runner or wild pig.

- Depending on your major, TAMUSA may or may not be the best. I know that our journalism program is on par with anyone else in the city and climbing fast to compete with the mainstays in Texas. Thing is, right now it's not much of a college ""experience"" that I wish some of the younger people would have. It'll get there in the coming years when they have dorms and eventually sports teams, but that's a long ways off. For nontraditional students like me, it's a great way to just get that damn degree without a fuss. 

- The student body is almost entirely from San Antonio, mainly Hispanic. The largest number of students actually come from the northwest side where Northwest Vista is at. There's also a lot of military who mainly make up the non-San Antonio students. I know that the freshmen/sophomore students in the fall will come from more parts of Texas. 

- As of right now there are no dorms and there's not really an apartment complex nearby. Starting in the fall, the university will try and get students into the Tobin Lofts near San Antonio College, but I would avoid that place like the plague because of all the crime that goes on there. You're best bet is searching out a good apartment and just deal with the commute. 

- Since there's not much around the main campus, there's not much to do. A lot of groups hold events at the campus, but since a lot of students commute as well as have jobs and kids, not many stick around for those events. 

So yeah, that's most of what you asked, but feel free to ask more. ",0

"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I don’t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me — besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide “Emergency” is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, I’m not strawman-ing if it’s true, right?  I’m not basing my entire  argument on this point, I’m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And that’s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (I’m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didn’t accuse me of this, but I’d still like to say that I’m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didn’t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",1

We are so very close to the precipice and they think they are so very sneaky, but this path is plain as day and has been for a few years now.

The top Republicans are scumbags who want this end too, but they won't act as quickly to get there because they seem to not have the same level of audacity to spit in their voters' faces and gaslight them about things they say they do want they actually do the opposite.

Learn about these things, don't take my word for it.  And don't use Google (or DuckDuckGo) if you don't want the CIA's official propaganda.  Again, this sounds crazy but take 10 seconds to look and your eyes will start opening.

"Mandatory body cams, we have the technology. Every job I've worked had cameras on me every minute of every day (2 different food service jobs and professional truck driving), my managers could even pull me in the office and explain to me with a play by play on a screen of how I could improve my work. You'd think both the police and the public would be clamoring for body cams to absolve either party of any wrong doing. Even then the videos get tampered with.

"Not sure why this isn’t on more peoples radars. I am a hardcore weather nerd who likes to look at the different computer model runs when there’s fun/scary weather approaching. The most commonly used models for forecasting (“Euro”, GFS, ICON, GEM) are in almost universal alignment  for a significant ice event starting Wednesday night around midnight and persisting till about 10am the next morning. The affected area will basically be everything from south of San Antonio to Austin. Also concern that we might not get above freezing on Thursday which would allow ice to persist. 

Some of the other weather nerds think there is a high likelihood of it occurring. I imagine local news/weather will wait until Monday before sounding the general warnings. It’s early for making any real forecast about what might happen but it’s jarring to see the models in alignment like this. Last weeks’ event had the models all over the place. Which I think is more typical. 

This is a pretty easy to use model run site should anyone want to take a look.

"Arguing that a new technology isn't progressive because the long term effect of that technology is going to cost people jobs is absurd.  However, Uber is kind of a dick company.  They have held smaller cities like ours hostage as negotiating technique against larger ""more valuable"" metropolii (sic?).  They have built their business model on the idea that they are a ""technology company"" (and therefore should not be taxed and governed like livery drivers).

"Little late to the game here, but just in case you're still reading this thread...

The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into. Companies are going to want sample code / programs for devs, they'll want certifications for anything from project managers, to sysadmins, to account managers. 

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students. Grads are much cheaper than an experienced hire, and the companies believe they can teach you everything you'll need to know from a technology standpoint. Most of these companies are also remote work, so you're not tied down to just what's available in the area. ",0

"I moved here from Denver.

It doesn't get that hot here (100ish, give or take) in the summer, but it's the *humidity* that kills me.  Walking outside feels like stepping into a sauna. You sweat and get sticky instantly. 
With the poor air quality (dust/pollen/stuff) I feel like Pig Pen.  You end up walking from air conditioned house, to air conditioned car, to air conditioned office etc.

You may be used to this in Ohio, so the winters here would be your happy place. It's less muggy and we rarely get below freezing for long. Snow is extremely rare and even ice days (roads closed when it rains while being below freezing) are very rare. 

The weather related issue that stands out is tires. Because of the generally dry climate, people use cheap, shitty and used tires. Tires on cars here are often bald (yeah, so I generally pay attention in parking lots) so a sprinkle of rain and it's vehicular bowling.

Ice days are to keep you home so other drivers don't careen into you. 

One major thing to consider is if you're prone to allergies. This place will make you suffer.

Actually, one major thing to consider is why you want to move here vs. any other place?

If you do have a leak, try giving SAWS a call to see if they can send a team out to help you find the leak.  You can also check yourself by turning everything off in the house, and then recording your water meter levels over an hour.  Check toilets, and especially sprinkler systems....

"Apartments in SA are on the verge of success of failure because so many people are moving here.  A bad Google/social media review can go a long way, especially if you leverage your neighbors to do the same.

Sorry for the roaches though, adopt some cats and become one with reddit.

Also a side thought, if you'd considered ceasing to pay rent because they aren't fixing the roaches, don't do that.  Texas lease law favors the landlord.  If your neighbor bad reviews don't get the apartment management in gear you probably have a way out because the unit is unfit for habitation, see what your lease says about pest control.",0

Remember when everyone was stoked about Hulu bringing a large center here and providing a lot of jobs? Remember when everyone was excited that a large Tech company finally recognized us as a viable job market? Yeah.... turns out it's just a call-center. I read that about 7-10% of the positions there require actual technical skills and college degrees. Everything else just requires a high school diploma and 1-2 years customer service experience. It doesn't affect my life directly but it sets a bad precedent for our city if these large companies are only seeing San Antonio as a place to plug another call center into. ,0

"Northwoods is our only sheet so ice time is somewhat limited.  There are a few leagues that are played:

* BHL is beginner league on Tuesday's which is a 10 game season that runs about $220 (about to expand to 6 teams though, and possibly a different night or an ultra late game).
* The ARL which is the ""rec league"" that plays on Wednesday/Fridays.  Unsure of season length but it will run about $20/week x duration.
* The AHL which is the competitive league that plays on Thursday/Sunday.  Also unsure of length/cost.

You get a lot of cross over in these leagues due to the limited ice time.  BHL is a newer league that the learn to play sessions were converted into b/c we had so many people.  Unfortunately for you that means you can't just come out and pay $20 for a single session like it was last year.  The shorter season cuts down on the cost a bit though.

If you are having an issue with costs reach out to Dale Henry, he is the hockey director and I'm fairly certain they will let you work out a payment plan if that is what works for you.

Depending on how busy the ice is, since it is the only sheet in town for all activities, drop-in and stick and puck times vary.  You will have to check their schedule (http://northwoodsice.maxgalaxy.net/Schedule.aspx?ID=6) to see when they are having them.  There used to be Wed drop-in but the ARL took that slot to accommodate 6 teams.

There are also a few groups of guys who will pool together and rent out private ice.  10 skaters per team plus goalies, usually for $21 each.  There are facebook groups for this.

First of all, I recommend /r/recruitinghell just so you don't feel all alone.  It's not super active, but sometimes it is nice to know other people are dealing with the same game.  \[Edit\] sub to /r/excel and learn everything you can

Second, get someone to practice interviewing with and have at least one person review your CV.  Talk to classmates (or anyone that you have worked with) and ask them to describe what was good about working with you.  Try to take those and create a blurb about what you bring to the table.

Third, linkedin is your friend.  Click the search box and then click all filters and narrow your search down.  After you find interesting companies/positions, search for people in accounting jobs there.  Ideally find something in common with someone and contact them.  If they are in hiring positions (controller/manager/cfo) say something like ""even though you aren't hiring entry level right now, I would like to have a 5 minute phone conversation to see if my skills might be of use to you in the future and also if I would be a good fit in the culture.""  Even really busy people are often willing to take 5 minutes to help someone out.  Also, be active.  Not like spam active, but like things that are relevant, comment where you have something intelligent say.  It moves you up the chain and increases your views.

Fourth, learn area codes in India and just swipe left on all those.

I only suggest this; as Nazis would be a pretty hard sell around here and the UFW flag is VERY distinctive and well...red.   A quick Google scan did not turn up any current contention between UFW and Wells Fargo though.

Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.

Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

At one point the technician asked me “what my expectations were”. I said my expectations were , find the issue, fix the issue, simple.
Then they did an “assessment”, and gave me 5 or 6 “options”.
Most of the options were adding a bunch of equipment I didn’t have or need and cost between 10,000 and 16,000 dollars.
They also offered financing of the repairs 10 years at 9% interest which is a total rip-off.

Mind you, this was a 5 year old, 2200 sq ft home.
The final option that the guy no shit called a “band-aid” was to replace the leaking condenser coil.
They didn’t have the parts in stock and had to come back with another tech to complete.

"So far, I've used both Sprint and AT&amp;T, but I've only used Ma Bell with my iPhones; when I had Sprint, I had a Palm Treo which I used data on (slow tethering and pre iPhone browsing).

Sprint wasn't fast, but I mostly blame CDMA and the Treo; cell service was fantastic and I always had full bars. Customer service with Sprint is HORRIBLE, and one of the reasons I left (besides the 3GS).

If you're going 4S, I recommend AT&amp;T for HSPA+ (pseudo 4G, more like 3.5G). CDMA just isn't as good, and I have a feeling Sprint's network will be slower based on multiple reports I've looked at.

If you get a 5, it doesn't matter as much, except for being outside of San Antonio. The only caveat is LTE brings data to the 5, not voice. So to do both, the phone falls back to CDMA for Sprint/Verizon, which means no talk/data at the same time; AT&amp;T still gets both over 3.5G.

Unlimited is great, so long as its usable. Just try out one and if you get bad service, return it while you can. If you're signing a contract; just get a 5. :)

Hope this helps!",0

not according to wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Cook

He first said the phrase ""the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings"" on a 1978 newscast discussing the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets. The phrase was then attributed to Bullets coach Dick Motta, who had borrowed it during Washington's successful 1978 title run.[7]

The Yale Book of Quotations later concluded that it first appeared in print in 1976, attributed to Texas Tech sports information director Ralph Carpenter, and was a variation on an old Southern saying.[1]",0

"That would be an example of a frivolous petition, most of those fail.

A petition is a representation of the petitioner's desires to enact change and, when the petitioners actually commit to the topic changes do occur.

Go for it, get your 100k signatures and maybe she will actually get the dye job done; politicians wear those stupid lapel pins because of ""popular opinion"" maybe your movement will have a similar effect.  Just make sure they're 100k real individuals, the power of a petition stems from actual people committed to it.

Edit: Wanted to add that its not a ""scam"" exactly. It's just not a smart investment if you run the numbers. These folks do a great job creating a sense of urgency about how the rebate program is going to end soon so you need to act NOW (and give us all that sweet loan interest for the next 20 years (ignoring the fact that solar panels will be much more efficient in 20 years and you're stuck with the crappy ones you bought 20 years ago)).",0

"I’m in the same boat as you I miss the gym a lot I go 6 days outta the week but I’m not gonna work all day then go and stand outside of the gym for an hour to an hour and a half

"My two cents. Take with a grain of salt because I've only lived here for about a year.

Unique: I moved here from Austin and was immediately struck by how much more history is apparent here. For context, San Antonio will celebrate its 300th anniversary this year at Fiesta. The Spanish Missions predate the American revolution by a couple generations. In contrast, everything in Austin feels bright and new -- part of its ""weird"", progressive, and tech-oriented culture. I don't mean that in a negative sense -- Austin's a fun town, but San Antonio feels much older than just about anywhere else in Texas. It's one of the things I've come to love about it.

Pros: Great museums and parks, cost of living is low (for now), lots of space, small town feel in a big city

Cons: Segregation, ""old money"", and abysmal funding for public education. IMHO, these go hand in hand, as property taxes determine how well (or poorly) local schools get funded. This effectively makes public schools like Alamo Heights ISD the equivalent of a private school, as families who want to send their kids to those programs have to afford a home in the ISD (a quick search will show you that houses in ""desirable"" ISDs tend to be much more expensive than those in the San Antonio ISD). 

Changes: Growth, and with it, gentrification. Most of the development seems to be on the north side of the city, though some efforts are being made to revitalize downtown. It wouldn't surprise me if more people start to look here as Austin becomes more and more expensive.

Passion: Spurs, big military community, Mexican culture, Bill Millers and Whataburger, Fiesta

Staple Dishes: Chili con carne, Tex-mex and ""interior"" Mexican food, some barbecue (though more of an emphasis on barbacoa). There's an interesting and insightful article/essay on how this plays out into the cultural differences between San Antonio and Austin here: https://endofaustin.com/2016/09/22/breakfast-taco-wars-race-history-and-food-in-austin-and-san-antonio/

Food Scene: Becoming more eclectic and ""modernized"" to attract and serve a growing young professional / ""hipster"" population. The Pearl houses a Culinary Institute of America campus that has been turning out excellent chefs who want to introduce new restaurants and shops in the city. Cured is one of the more famous newer spots in the city -- the head chef was nominated for a James Beard award. Lots of local favorites for tacos, from the more ""Austin"" style (Torchy's Tacos) to more traditional Mexican (Taquitos on West Ave).

There is the San Antonio Sports and Social Club that can be super fun (soccer, softball, cornhole, kickball, etc.). 

If you’re into art, be sure to follow Blue Star Arts Complex on Instagram, and also just go hang out there. They host events literally everyday. My wife and I went to peruse the galleries, ended up connecting with a couple artists, and then stumbled onto a fashion show with an open bar. Be sure to start following different galleries and artists when Blue Star tags them on Insta. For music, there’s Jazz TX, Luna, Lonesome Rose, Paper Tiger, etc.

"Multiverse Games on Hildebrand has a really great collection of people who will teach you if you ask and everyone there is pretty respectful to other people too. They also have an in-house adventurers league for D&amp;D, and many different game nights and tournaments. They're mostly focused on Magic and Warhammer with their products, but they also have other board games and D&amp;D stuff, especially dice and minis.

Knights Watch on Blanco is also good, but I don't frequent there as much so I can't vouch for the people, they're focused a little more on D&amp;D than other board games, but they do have the biggest collection of board games I've seen. The interior is also really cool, and the owners have 2 huskies.

Court of Gamers on 281 is also good, with a focus on D&amp;D and other RPGs like pathfinder.

The Dragon's Lairs and Alien Worlds do have board games and rooms to play, but at least half of the stores are dedicated to comics and toys, though Dragon's Lair has more board games. I also don't go in often enough to either to get a good sense of the regulars there.


These are all really good options, and I'm sure the other places listed here are great too, the best choice for you just depends on what exactly you're looking for at any given time (Card games vs D&amp;D vs Board games vs comics and toys)

Also, if you're just looking to maybe find a D&amp;D game, San Antonio Dungeons and Dragons is a group on facebook with a pretty active community.

&gt;*Five Ways To Make Your Resume Sink Faster Than The Titanic*
&gt;
&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement – I swap “Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoint” for “Proficient in Breathing Oxygen” and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes I’ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to “sink” your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with “Fluency in English,” I assume you are “fluent” in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So don’t re-assure me.

&gt;While most employers definitely want to know you as a person and the things you enjoy in your off time, pull off all of those ""special skills"" that everyone has and just aren't important for your job. Things like ""Microsoft Office (all ver.)"" or ""Windows and Mac Operating Systems"" are not only implied for any job that requires use of a computer, they take up space you could use to make a real impact—or better yet, keep your resume trim and to the point.

We've got some kind of drainage pond and that cost is another $400/month to maintain.

Then there's security cameras, which has to have internet service, so there's another $50/month.

And the stupid gate itself, you know how people can call you on that gate?  Well that means it has to have phone service, so that's basically another $50/month.

And the street lamps need power, so does the gate, and the security cams, so that's another $50/month in electricity.

Then we've got to get the common area trees trimmed, but that has to be done by a certified arborist so that's another whatever the hell that costs.

I'm sure you're heard about how AT&amp;T is doing away with 3G, well our stupid gate system for some reason only works with AT&amp;T and wouldn't work after the 3G goes away so we have to upgrade that damn thing which cost us about $2k.  Got 3 different places to quote it and $2k was the best we could do.  


And on top of all of that we use some property management company to handle all the petty bullshit above, and I think that's something like $400-600/month.  There's developments happening around us and we're having to pull in a lawyer now for consultation too and that's just more and more money :(",0

"I'm not sure the real reason for the phone.

I think in the beginning, with flip phones, before cameras, the phone was banned so you don't bother other people with phone rings or actually talking.

These days, with video apps, you could say the phone ban is needed because a video call could be used by someone buying your vote and making sure you vote the way you are told. I don't know what would have happened in the past if you took a camera in the booth to photograph your ballot.

But I think the current ban on cell phones is still just a holdover about not making noise and being distracting. Laws take a long time to change.",1
" Well, the idea is not that everyone could walk, bike, or take a scooter, but that by allowing more people to walk, bike, take the bus, etc, it alleviates traffic and encourages dense communities vs sprawl. 

Definitely not impossible. I remember some people from the office of sustainability came to my urban planning class in college, they had a million ideas to improve things. Problem is that implementation is quashed by business, state government, NIMBYs, etc. 

I think it's naive to say that SA will ever have fewer drivers than other forms of commuters, but it is definitely possible to improve things.

You should do some research, for instance super blocks in Barcelona. There are other countries tackling similar problems and doing it well. I think part of the solution is dispelling the idea that public transportation inherently has to work to get people to and from every corner of the city. I live downtown. I have no reason to see the 80 millionth taco bell that just opened up next to a new subdivision. Creating walkable districts  with a few connecting routes to get to other areas of the city could be a great compromise. If we encourage businesses to move back downtown, that creates an easy way to move lots of people to and from their place of work along central arteries. 

There are ways to help things, to move to a better future. They're just hard so we don't do them.

"Reason I like Waze:  
  
- Road Closures (Not all of them, but more than GMaps, as GMaps gets its closure info from Waze)
- Updates are volunteer managed
  - More accurate maps given lots of changing highways due to construction
  - Additions like Parking Lot Roads or New neighborhoods can be live in the app in as little as 18 hours. 
- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps
- Hazard &amp; Police Reports  
  
As a delivery driver, I am ALL OVER the city (Though, admittedly, south of 90 doesnt order much from amazon). And I've use Waze and Google maps, even tried apple maps (for about 5 minutes) and various other paid navigation apps... The only reasonable options are Google Maps and Waze, but I still prefer Waze over Google Maps.  
  
Also, Waze only gets better the more people use it. Even more accurate traffic data (Though its very good as it is), and faster updates for road closures and reopenings, accidents, etc.  
  
Also, I LOVE when people give me delivery notes ""My address isnt in GPS so turn here, exit here, go X etc...."" I just put the address in Waze and 90% of the time at very least the road has been mapped, if not the individual house number too.

They're valuable and require training, I certainly don't deny that, but computer programmers are at least as difficult to find and train as executives (I'd argue more difficult), and they aren't paid nearly as much. Clearly something is going on beyond supply and demand here, and I'd argue that it's the fact that American executives realized that basically they set their own wages so they started jacking them up.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""

&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",0

"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",1

"Utility location equipment.... I think.  I have not used this equipment, but I understand the general idea of it, so my terminology is going to be wrong, so I will describe my understanding of it's function, so perhaps you can understand what it is.

There is a generator that pumps a signal through a wire underground  A receiving wand is waved over the ground attempting to pick up the signal being pumped into the ground to find the path of the wire.

My understanding is that this equipment can be used to find buried phone lines, pipes  and fiberoptic (If a tracer line was also installed with it)  and the depth of the buried item.

I have an old locator that I think works, but it' s not a pretty piece of machinery, and a newer one that was not used much- yet still an older model.  They have been sitting in the garage for years.

My husband wanted to go into locating for himself, but never got around to it.

There is also another wand that is used to detect metal, but it's just a wand and does not have a transmitter  (and is not the same type of equipment  as the transmitter/ receiver combo)

edit:  this ""other wand""  does not detect depth, but  just goes ""beeeeeeep""  when it detects metal.",0
"Funny how you say that, since sociology is one of the fields that marxism has decided to influence most of all. Because it is a very soft science, it has been easy for them to influence. But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)

So in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google. Sure there is something to it - if someone keen on learning could never get to the library, and if there was no Internet or no book stores, maybe they would never learn anything and become what they can be. But in practice that problem hardly exists. Political measures today is mostly about throwing money away on projects that almost never generate any measurable results, just so politicians can win votes by showing how ""good"" their intentions are.

Enough about that. Again, NO, the reason why many ""homeless"" people has been seen in SA is NOT that the city is too difficult to walk in. On the contrary - criminals who have lost their driving license due to drugs and other crime will move their hustling to cities where the weather is good and it is easy to get around by walking. While people who want to work hard and get a honest career will invest whatever money they could come up with on a car and live in a city with little crime and where honesty and hard work pays off, even if the climate is hard and it is difficult to walk.",1

"There you go making shit up again.

I don't want your acceptance and you aren't showing ANY liberal view points. You're an auth left.

Lib right is on the conservative spectrum. You can't ignore the fact that far lefties like you have pushed the bar so far left that the conservative right now includes classical liberalism.

Lets look at some other conservative right-leaning + liberal-leaning centrist views:

* Mega corps like facebook and twitter are guilty of creating monopolies and censoring dissent at the behest of the left to interfere with the election.
* Mega corps like Amazon and Walmart supported the lockdowns to kill small business and force people under their thumb and destroy the middle class.
* CRT is a racist belief system that should be banned from government funded training and schools.
* Middle east intervention needs to cease; Bush and Obama are both equally as guilty of it.
* The drug war is racist and should be abolished.
* There's nothing wrong with gay marriage.
* Trans people don't belong in gender segregated sport systems.
* Children should not be allowed to transition.
* Police need more accountability for their actions; however defunding the police is a terrible idea.

Many of those are also in line with traditional conservatism; some are not. **You do not understand what liberalism is. Classical liberalism is now right of center - authoritarian leftists like you pushed it there. Progressives are not Liberals.**",1

"Since I cover video games on my site, [cheap plug](http://original-gamer.com/), I've met up with some local developers. Like others have said, there isn't much. It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go. 

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies. 

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store. 

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!

"Yes, it's most highly concentrated in water vapor. But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up. Frankly I'm surprised more places aren't installing UV lights in the ducting to disinfect the air, it's a proven technology that was being slowly rolled out before this year.

"Yep.  It does nothing to actually diagnose and solve the problem.  Having a lay person do those things gives the potential for them to seriously damage the coil.  Changing the filter is never a really bad idea if it needs changing BUT unless it is completely clogged with crap it's not going to make that big a difference.

Also, what is on the coil?  Is it dirt?  That implies a bigger problem if it's dirt and dust buildup.  A problem with the ducts.  Is it growth they are cleaning off?  If so it's going to be back and it's probably permeated every single part of that HVAC system ( including the ducts and their home ).  That requires a whole slew of other things to actually fix the problem.

Two reasons to ice up.  Low on refrigerant and bad airflow.  Two reasons for low refrigerant is a leak or not charged up right to begin with ( how old is the system? ).  Bad airflow is usually a fan problem but can be (rarely) an obstruction problem.

In no way does cleaning the coil and/or changing the filter going to fix those problems and there is a huge possibility that they damage the coil trying to clean it which means big bucks.

The best thing to do is call a professional and find out what the real problem is.  It should take a competent tech about 20 minutes to give a system a once over and another 15-20 to check the refrigerant levels.  In an hour a competent tech can tell you exactly what's wrong.

Call a professional.  Also, sign up for a maintenance plan.  At a minimum they will come out every year ( some do twice a year ) and clean your outdoor coil, check all the electrical systems, check airflow, and give you a list of things that are

A) immediate needs

B) near future needs

C) optional improvements to your system

The company I worked for also gave a free leak test if the system was low and they were on a maintenance plan.  This way we could identify the problem early and get it handled before it went from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing I did when my wife and I bought our house in 2019 was install a good filtration system ( the 1 inch filters are complete dogshit ) that uses 3 inch filters that are replaced once a year ( google aprilaire ) and a complete UV system to destroy anything that might grow inside the system.  Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.  Other than regular maintenance costs ( replacing bulbs/filters etc ) our systems will be going strong for a good bit longer than the average 11-12 years in our climate.",0

"Eyup. You're 100% right and here's the numbers on why:

&amp;#x200B;

It is possible to find a studio apartment in SA for about $550/month.

Minimum wage works out to about $1,160/month.

Meaning that after rent a person has $610 to pay for everything else. Food, gas, car, insurance, healthcare, phone, electricity, water, everything.

And SA is a one of the cheaper places to live.

&amp;#x200B;

It ain't avocado toast and Starbucks that's making people poor, it's low wages.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and I know it's a side issue, but I never understood how avocado toast got to be the go to example of those awful young people wasting money. A loaf of bread at HEB is about ten cents a slice, an avocado typically costs about a dollar and you can get at least four pieces of avocado toast out of each one. 

So the total cost per piece of avocado toast is about 35 cents. Two for breakfast is 70 cents. \*\*THAT\*\* is the platonic example of how wasteful young people are spending their money on frivolities? Spending less than a dollar for breakfast is bad now Boomers?",0

"A lot of people here have ideas about how reddit works but I don't think they actually spend much time looking at the subreddit rules that make reddit work and that make a lot of the subreddits what they are. 

A quick glance at some default subs will reveal that rules for submissions are the norm. 

/r/funny banes tumbler and even reddit.com. That's right, you can't link to a reddit url on /r/funny.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow. 

So the idea that reddit is all about some free market of ideas where the up and down arrows choose what is and is not displayed is demonstrably false. Just like the best news rooms have strong editorial guidelines, so must the best subreddits.

That's like saying it's my birthday and I get a phone call telling me I should eat cake. Sure it may be unconventional, but I'm sure as hell not gonna get upset over something so petty. The fact that they took the time out to even call is better than what most people do. I realize it's his job, but be grateful he even talked about it. I personally believe women's day, black history month, Hispanic heritage, and the lot are very sorry holidays. It's saying ""we were mistreated so now recognize us"" well maybe it would go a lot more smoothly if instead of boasting about it you fight for true equality. Don't expect men to open doors for you or not hit you when you swing first. I was raised a gentleman of Texas quality, but after experiencing life and the equality fights, it's only fair to have TRUE equality or none at all. That being said, you don't need a holiday to stamp your mark on history ""you know it, I know it, everybody knows it"" therefore it can only be used as a medium to attract sorrow and attention.

"I’d still go cat6 just for the lower s/n ratio. It’s possible they’ve done a building fiber with a router that’s sending cat5 cable to carry the “fiber” to each unit. I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. You’re still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels you’re using. All in all there are lots of reasons it could be underperforming. If you’re using a VPN that’s also a factor (although I wouldn’t use a VPN just to test speed). Hope that helps..",0

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.",1

"More concerts have been canceled as tensions escalate between musicians and management of the San Antonio Symphony.

“Russian Masters” on Nov. 19-20, “Beethoven’s ‘Emperor’ Concerto” on Nov. 26-27, and “Holidays at The Majestic” on Dec. 18 have all been canceled by the Symphony Society of San Antonio, the board that oversees the orchestra’s operations.

According to Symphony spokesperson Kimberly Maldonado, “San Antonio Symphony Box Office representatives will contact all ticket holders directly over the phone in the coming days to ensure they understand next steps and all ticketing options.”

Following the Sept. 27 declaration of a strike by the Musicians of the San Antonio Symphony, the season-opening concerts of Oct. 28-29 and Nov. 5-6 were also canceled, with musicians periodically leafleting and picketing outside their main performance venue, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.

The dispute deepens
---

The latest development in the ongoing dispute is a charge by the Symphony Society filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Oct. 29, alleging bad-faith bargaining by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 23, which represents the musicians in contract negotiations for the national union.

The Symphony Society’s charge follows an earlier NLRB charge filed by AFM Local 23 on Oct. 25, alleging that the Symphony Society has engaged in unfair labor practices and bad-faith bargaining. When management informed the union it was canceling musicians’ health and other benefits on Oct. 28, the union added “Repudiation/Modification of Contract” to its earlier charge.

John Ferguson, the attorney representing orchestra management, said the Symphony Society’s charge is not a counter-charge but is wholly independent of the union’s earlier charge.

“Even if the union hadn’t filed their charge, I think the symphony probably would have filed their own,” Ferguson said.

A major part of the charge alleges that the union did “not [live] up to the letter and spirit of the parties’ agreement to first attempt to use interest based bargaining,” and refused to accept mediation by Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service commissioners.

Interest-based bargaining (IBB), also known as mutual gains bargaining, is a negotiation strategy meant to avoid adversarial bargaining, opting instead for “consensus-seeking and cooperative” negotiations.

David Van Os, attorney for the musicians, said mediators present for the earlier IBB negotiation sessions showed bias toward management, in part because the musicians were not allowed to focus on the 80% pay cuts they had endured during the height of pandemic cancellations in 2020.

“When we were trying to explain the background leading up to here, one of those mediators told us that that was just all baggage and that she didn’t want to hear about it,” Van Os said.

“They want a mediator so badly, that they must think that a mediator will convince the union to agree to their demands,” he added.

‘Rocks in their head’
---

The Symphony Society charge further accuses the union of negotiating in bad faith, refusing to continue negotiations, and imposing conditions for a return to bargaining.

Van Os called the charge an attempt to deflect attention from the union’s earlier charge. “If they’re charging us in bad faith, they’ve got rocks in their head.”

The union has called for management to rescind the contract imposed on Sept. 26 before negotiations can continue. The contract matches management’s “last, best, final offer,” which reduces the number of full-time musicians in the orchestra from 71 to 42, fills 26 other positions with part-time musicians, and makes drastic wage cuts of 33% for full-timers and what union members have described as “poverty level” annual wages of $11,000 for part-timers.

Van Os said the two sides met last week for a grievance session outside the formal negotiations, and the union told management “if you will withdraw that [last, best, final offer] label … and if you will agree to rescind the unilaterally imposed conditions, we will be happy to come back to the bargaining table. But we’re not going to do it unless it’s on an equal playing field.”

Ferguson, once an attorney for the NLRB in the 1980s, said, “that’s not the way it works in bargaining. We’re not asking the union to call off their strike as a condition to return to the table.”

He said management might well be willing to move away from its last, best, final offer, but nothing can be determined until the two sides return to negotiations.

“We’ll consider all proposals … and hopefully arrive at some kind of mutually agreeable contract. Both sides are going to have to move — the Symphony realizes that they may have to move from their last best and final. … They may very well move. But we won’t know that until we get to the table and negotiate.”

The law is clear, Ferguson said. “You can’t condition bargaining.”

Ferguson said the imposed contract applies only to the third year of the original three-year contract negotiated in 2019 and does not bear on future contracts. But Van Os said agreeing to the imposed contract terms for even the remainder of the 2021-2022 season would prove disastrous for the symphony.

“We believe that we would never be able to get the symphony to get off of them if we agreed to them. They are completely intolerable. They will destroy the San Antonio symphony,” Van Os said. “And it looks to me like right now, the board is trying to destroy the symphony. This is their doing, and it will be their historical legacy.”",0

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form. 

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well.

"I mean I know my kind when I see them as a thick woman. ?? But thick doesn't mean ugly, and for sure there are still people of thin or average body type too. Just coming here from the east coast, there's certainly a lot more thick guys and girls than there are over there. I blame the horrid weather tbh, no one wants to consistently go out in 110 degrees.

And to OP, I'd say identify your interests and find meet ups with people in the same interests before jumping straight into the dating scene. Not saying that dating apps and stuff are bad, but it seems a lot more people that make friends first before they start dating tend to hit it off really well.",0

"You can find templates online pretty easily. But an answer is as simple as filing a handwritten note, just make sure it has the correct cause number on it and you sign it. 

Filings are done through e-file these days, but that requires setting up an account and paying for it. That’s probably not practical for you considering you’re not in the business of regularly filing documents with the court. 

Judging by the 14 day deadline you referenced, I’m assuming your suit was filed in JP court. Contact the court clerk and ask if you can file by fax or in person. I’m not sure how JP courts are operating right now during COVID nor the chances someone will actually answer the phone. You may need to do this in person. Here is the link for JP courts https://www.bexar.org/3145/Justice-of-the-Peace

Lastly, you’re gonna need to speak with the plaintiff sooner or later. You should have been served with a petition signed by the attorney. Call him/her to discuss the case. Often times these things can be whittled down through one lump payment, or through payment plans without need to go to court. Good luck.",0

"Got an auto reply that my comment was removed for a phone number (posted Bexar animal control which can be found on google) so reposting again without the number - sorry if it appears twice.

Original -
I saw someone suggest nextdoor and that will probably be your best bet! I was on the other side about a year ago (found a couple dogs wandering and was trying to track down the owners) and that’s what did the trick. If you have a neighborhood Facebook group try that as well. Also try animal control and some local vets each day, though hopefully you’ll find her more quickly. Someone may have come across her and called animal control - it can take them until the next business day to pick up after a call - or taken her in to a vet to see if she’s chipped. 

Hope you’re reunited with your pup soon and she just came across someone trying to keep her safe!",0
"There are plenty of options to make calls safely while driving. Bluetooth, whether through an earpiece or through the newer accessories provided by automobile manufacturers. Hands-free calling directly from the phone: my android allows me to press and hold the home button for a few seconds, then say ""call (name)"". I could even do that on my old iPhone. 

If you aren't willing and/or able to utilize these options then the rest of us absolutely want you to stay off your phone while driving, but don't lump everyone onto the same group.",0
"I spoke to the ones at my polling place too and they said they had people come with signs to protest them. (I got Facebook ads from those people which made me look for the petition to sign it lol.)

Only from a commercial perspective. The city uses them to manage their copiers and getting them out there to fix problems was like pulling teeth. We'd have to call 5-6 times just to get a single tech out and then a few more times to get the problem truly fixed.,0

"Ha! A bit sensitive… I was being very genuine. When people are nervous, and someone else is doing the talking, i.e. interviewer, people can tend to fidget, tap, a pen, take deep breaths, etc. Muting your phone when you’re not talking is a great way to ensure you’re not adding any disruptions or distractions. 
But please, carry-on.",0

"Hey man. You may want to check with some of the local game stores for tabletop stuff, they have really strong communities. If you just like general boardgaming fun I recommend Knights Watch. Great community and good store and a chill place to play and hang. Check out their Facebook for events and stuff. If you're into things like 40k or Bolt Action or something there's lots of stores that do that too, PM me for more details.

For beers, check out some of the local bars that do fun community nights. Personally I'm a fan of the Bombay Bicycle Club's trivia night, Alamo Beer Company does some stuff that's fun. Lots of other solid smaller breweries too (Brew Monkey, Isela Street).

If you're looking for a fun physical thing with a good community, strong recommend to Armadillo Boulders, a really great climbing gym that's down by the Pearl.

Hope you find a good thing man. Best of luck. This is a great city, I hope it shows you the love you deserve.",0

Google maps usually has pretty good places.,0
Check if your area has Google fiber. Spectrum sucks ass and charges too much. I heard Grande was good tho,0
Yea. I suggest to use google pin all the places you need to go to and decide. These are very specific request. North downtown is all I can think of.,0
It would've been pretty fckd up to order on any delivery apps right now anyway.,0
"Keep in mind it’s way cheaper for your A/C company to tell you there isn’t a problem and it’s just something you have to deal with than it is to send someone out and possibly find a real issue that they have to correct under warranty.

I ran into this same situation with my first new-construction home.  I I had a room that was always warmer than all the others — called the A/C company to check it out (within the first year) and they showed up with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to get different readings to tell me it was within spec.  They also threw in other nonsensical reasons like getting more sun than other rooms (even though it shared a wall with two other bedrooms that didn’t have cooling issues).  Basically they gave me a big list of reasons why they shouldn’t have to do any actual work.  Note that at no point did they even look at the unit or duct work in the attic.

  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  

It would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking “it meets specs” and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didn’t stop to consider anything else.",0
"Cristina's Jewelry in Castle Hills. Old school San Antonio family for generations. Inside Loop 410 at the Blanco Junction shopping center. Always fair.

I've never sold there, only bought - but I've witnessed many a transaction and have known the family since 2000. If you come in person, they are kind enough to tell you what your items are worth in the current market and why. They have always been about repeat business and building relationships. They respect your time.

Just be careful you don't spend the money you get for your gold/diamonds then and there. The place is stocked with treasures - art that has appraised value; antique furniture, carpets, lamps, glass, vases, depression glass, crystal in all sizes and shapes, chandeliers; Icons; old stained glass windows and tiffany lamps; signed native american turquoise with some pieces over a hundred years old, etc... They are willing to work with you on payment and prices. Their word and handshake mean something.

They also employ a smith who can work on any kind of stone or metal - so repairs, modification, or fabrication are all possible.  Perhaps change your ring into something new and cool? All for a fair price and in a timely fashion.

Ask for Quinn. His masters is in Art History and he used to teach at UTSA before taking on the business full time with his mother after his father passed a few years ago. 

Check out their facebook, but don't be intimidated by how nice the photos and items are. Hint: Bargain hard. Everyone from bartenders to taxi drivers to chefs to judges to politicians to pro athletes shop, hang out and sell there.
